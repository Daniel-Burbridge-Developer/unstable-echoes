# Unstable Echoes

_AI Generation tool for building a persistent RPG world and characters_

---

## Integration & API Setup

- [ ] **Hook up Hugging Face API**
  - [ ] Register for a Hugging Face account and generate an API key.
  - [ ] Set up a secure backend endpoint (or proxy) to handle API calls so your token isn’t exposed.
  - [ ] Test connectivity with a simple “hello world” prompt to confirm integration.

---

## Text Generation Module

- [ ] **Build the Text API Call**
  - [ ] Allow user input for a base prompt (e.g., “Describe a mysterious character from the realm…”).
  - [ ] Define a flexible JSON schema for the generated description (e.g., fields: _name_, _backstory_, _personality traits_, _visual style_).
  - [ ] _(Optional)_ Allow users to predefine or customize parts of the JSON schema.
- [ ] **Display & Variation Options for Text**
  - [ ] Present the generated text in an engaging UI (use RPG-inspired fonts and graphics).
  - [ ] Offer a “Generate Variations” button to view alternative outputs.
  - [ ] Allow users to “lock in” parts they like before regenerating other sections.

---

## Image Generation Module

- [ ] **Build the Image API Call**
  - [ ] Use the text output (or selected JSON fields) as the prompt for the image generation API (e.g., Stable Diffusion).
  - [ ] Refine the prompt to match the desired art style (e.g., dark, mystical, chaotic).
- [ ] **Display & Variation Options for Images**
  - [ ] Display the generated image alongside the corresponding text.
  - [ ] Provide options for multiple image variations.
  - [ ] Include an interface to “tweak” the prompt if necessary.

## User Interface & Creative Direction

- [ ] **Theming & Consistency**
  - [ ] Design the UI with RPG and “unstable” motifs (e.g., rugged visuals, mysterious color palettes).
  - [ ] Use custom icons, fonts, and color schemes that align with the persistent mythos.
- [ ] **Inter-App Consistency**
  - [ ] Integrate a persistent “mythos library” to store generated characters and lore for reuse across your apps.
  - [ ] Consider linking character bios or story snippets from Unstable Echoes to other themed applications in your suite.

## Additional Features & Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Customization & Tweaking**
  - [ ] Allow users to adjust parameters for text and image generation (e.g., creativity level, tone, style variations).
  - [ ] Implement a simple editor for minor tweaks on the JSON output before sending it for image generation.
- [ ] **User-Generated Content & Persistence**
  - [ ] Offer features to save and catalog generated characters/world elements for future reference.
  - [ ] Provide export options (e.g., JSON export, downloadable image files) for integration into other projects.
- [ ] **Feedback & Iteration**
  - [ ] Include user feedback options (ratings, comments) to refine the generation process over time.
  - [ ] Incorporate an option to “remix” previous outputs for a fresh twist while retaining key elements.
